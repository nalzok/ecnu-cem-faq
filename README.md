# ECNU CEM Freshmen FAQ's [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ecnu-cem-faq/badge/)](http://ecnu-cem-faq.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/)


## Introduction

I've noticed that identical questions had been asked many times by different freshmen in multiple QQ groups, and old students had to answer them seperately. Moreover, some of these questions can actually be answered by a chatbot named "å‡›" (they is cute, by the way), whose capability is apparently underestimated.

To me, a [lazy][lazy] man, this routine is extremely inelegant, so I started this project, which is an attempt to deliver the relevent information to freshmen who have any doubt in an efficient way.


## Goal

It aims to build a F\[requently\]A\[sked\]Q\[uestion\] knowledge base, where most questions a freshman may have have presumably been answered. In addition, when a new question is asked, everyone can see the question and corresponding answer, so similiar questions won't be asked again.


## Features

+ static_cast\<adjective\> Centralized management of comprehensive Q&A contents
+ Easily accessible wherever a Web browser is available
+ Maintained by a large community, rather than by only a few people
+ Flexible and thus can be frequently updated
+ Partially written by freshmen, who understand themselves best


## How To Contribute

It's really easy!

You have to [join Github][join] before you can make any contribution.

If you want to report an error, or add an entry, or start a discussion, please [create an issue][issue], and we will update the repo as soon as possible. You can also comment below others' issues to discuss them. And of course, supporting this project by simply sharing it with your friends is an option, too!

Please remember that this is going to be a big project, and *every bit counts*.


## Contribution Guidelines

There are some rules that you should keep in mind when contributing. **DO READ THEM CAREFULLY!!!**

+ General:

  + Be nice to each other.

+ When reporting errors:

  + The issue's title should begin with a `[ER]`(error report).
  + Add a link to the page in question.
  + Quote the paragraph where the error resides.
  + Explain what the errors are, and how to fix them.

+ When adding new entries:

  + The issue's title should begin with a `[NE]`(new entry).
  + Since this project features the Q&A form, *the title must be in the form of a question*. This means when you have some great stuff to share with others, please come up with a corresponding question first.
  + Open a title-only issue before starting writing the answer. You can edit the issue description later. This avoids people working on the same topic without knowing each other.

    + If you are a freshman who don't know the answer to your question, indicate this by changing the title tag from `[NE]` to `[NEW]`(new entry - waiting).
    + If you are an answer writer, change the title tag to `[NEC]`(new entry - completed) after you finished.

  + Be aware of copyright-related issues.
  + Avoid trivial copy & pasting. When referencing other sources, make sure to edit the content to make it fit the question.

+ When starting discussions:

  + The issue's title should begin with a `[DS]`(discussion).
  + Be specific. No gossiping.


## Meta Q&A

+ Q: Why is this project in English?
+ A: ~~Well, I'm just too lazy to write a Chinese version.~~ This project is actually in Chinese; only its README is in English. I believe writing project descriptions in English is an unspoken rule of Github, and I see no special reasons to break it in this case. It is still possible that we'll have a Chinese version someday, though.


Any advice or contribution would be appreciated!
